Finished turret and (kind of) gunner. Gunner AI is basically just a copy right now, and it uses the turret's model. Whatever, it works. Next step is
recreating Doom 2's entryway as a first level. I mostly just wanted to get things ready for level one since it's been almost two months since I
started this. Finally, some tangible progress has been made.
